## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Second, generate the embeddings of the documents in the `./data` directory (if this folder exists - otherwise, skip this step):

```
npm run generate
```

Third, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
